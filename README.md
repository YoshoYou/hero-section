# React + TypeScript + Vite

#In this application I used vite instead of create-react-app especially for using typeScript and tailwind and beacause it is away faster.I included Nav section for better looking plus,this app support both arabic and english language with availability to support more language as desirable.I used i18next react library for that by installing the package via : 
# npm i react-i18next i18next --save                    
and library for detecting the languages we use via :
# npm install i18next react-i18next i18next-browser-languagedetector  &  npm install i18next-http-backend  
then I made locales folder to store two files each one of them contains the content in different language { we must do that}

you can change the mood theme in this app since we are programmer and I don't like light mood so we have dark one.
I know I should use createContext but it is new for me I will try to edit the code and use it.

after learning typeScript , this is the first time I use it in my application so it is a bit tricky
you must install the node package after cloning my repo via : npm i
# HeroSection inside the Components/hero/HeroSection.tsx
# then run : npm run dev to start the app.

# thank you so much ^--^
